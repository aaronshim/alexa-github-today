# Github Today
An Alexa skill that tells you about some popular repositories and recent commits.

## Motivation
I wanted to try building an Alexa skill and evaluate how easily the Alexa Skills Kit allowed developers to get started.

## Setup
This project is heavily based off of the template [alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact). You will need to set up a AWS Lambda to run this script, as detailed in the README of that template.
